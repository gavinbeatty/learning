# Shake learning

I have a [git mirror] of [Shake], ndm's amazing build system.

[git mirror]: https://github.com/gavinbeatty/shake-mirror
[Shake]: http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/darcs/shake/

Using that, I'm just playing around with it and trying to design something
like boost-build using Shake.

I also like the capability of shipping standalone executables that mean
whatever compiler is the only necessary build pre-requisite.
